Place it on a flat, hard surface away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Avoid using it for heavy tasks like gaming or streaming while it cools. You can also try closing unused apps running in the background. If the phone continues to overheat, check if any apps are consuming excessive resources and consider restarting the phone to refresh its system."
